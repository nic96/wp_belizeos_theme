# Wordpress Nomad Theme
Another Wordpress theme

I couldn't find any theme that suited me right so I created my own.

Customizing theme colors is easily done from the admin customize page (more customization options planned).

I did all developing with apache 2.4 and php 7.

Note: This theme is still WIP so there are still a few bugs and things to fix.

### Features
* Custom background
* Custom colors
* This theme is responsive and looks good on both mobile and desktop computer
* Sticky Footer
* Responsive height footer (The footer changes height depending on the content)
* Light. This theme loads fast (Unless you set a huge background image)
* Option Two column layout
* Right sidebar widgets
* Footer widgets
* Uses fontawesome icons https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* License: [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later

### Limitations
The navbar currently only supports menus up to a depth of two. (You can't have a submenu of a submenu)

There might be more limitiations that I don't know of yet since this is my first theme and I haven't done a lot of testing.
